# DHBins
Hexagonal maps for NZ District Health Boards and Regions

The easiest way to install the package in R is to use the `remotes` package from CRAN

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tslumley/DHBins")
```

If you want to use the map layouts for DHBs and regions but not the software, you can do that under the Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license (or the GPL as applied to the code: your choice)
